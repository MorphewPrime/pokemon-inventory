# Pokemon Go inventory!

This is an app created for fun that helps display, manage, and learn more about your pokemon which have been exported from a modded version of pokemon go.

### Some basic featrues inculde 
- Display each pokemon's stats and moves with different colors to help differentiate attack type.
- Search with a given string to help filter by moves, names, level, CP ect.
- Filter with a drop-down by selecting either CP Level, IV, Pokedex number, Name, Generation, Candy amount, and Attack/Defense/Stamina stats.
- Filter drop-down order can be reversed.
- Checkbox to show only shinies.

This is my first time in a while coming back to this app for screenshots, and it seems that all the first moves have the same color regardless of the move type. Don't know when this broke but I prob won't ever fix it as ISpoofer (the app that exports the data my site uses) is dead.
